    "## HTML and the DOM\n",
    "\n",
    "We will scrape web-pages that are (partially) written in HTML and represented in the DOM. \n",
    "\n",
    "*DOM* stands for *Document Object Model*, while *HTML* stands for *“HyperText Markup Language”*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thirty years ago, HyperText Markup Language used to be a meaningful description of what HTML actually did: it has links (hypertext), and it is a markup language. \n",
    "\n",
    "The latest version of HTML, however, the HTML5 standard, does much, much more: graphics, audio, video, etc. So it is easier to think of HTML as “whatever it is that web browsers know how to interpret”, and just not think about the actual term."

   "source": [
    "### Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "The important thing about HTML is that the markup is represented by *elements*. An HTML element is a portion of the content that is surrounded by a pair of tags of the same name. Like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<strong>This is an HTML element.</strong>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this element, **strong** is the name of the **tag**; the *open* tag is `<strong>`, and the *matching closing tag* is `</strong>`. The way you should interpret this is that the text “This is an HTML element” should be “strong”, i.e., typically this will be bold text.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML elements can and commonly do nest:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<strong>This is strong, and <u>this is underlined and strong.</u></strong>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The nesting might be easier to see if we format it like this:\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<strong>\n",
    "    This is strong, and \n",
    "    <u>\n",
    "        this is underlined and strong.\n",
    "    </u>\n",
    "</strong>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the names, opening tags can contain extra information about the element. These are called attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<a href='http://www.google.com'>A link to Google's main page</a>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we’re using the `a` element which once stood for “anchor”, but now is almost universally used as a “link”. The attribute `href` means “HTML reference”. The meaning given to each attribute changes from element to element. Elements can be given arbitrary attributes, but only some are actually interpreted by most browsers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other important attributes for our purposes are `id` and `class`. These attributes are fairly universally and widely used in the modern web due to the DOM. The **id** attribute gives the attribute a unique identifier, which can then be used to access the element programmatically. Think of it as making the element accessible via a global variable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The **class** is similar but is intended to be applied to a whole “class” of elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "### An HTML Page\n",

Selecting those groups of tasks can be done through CSS *selectors*.\n",

To avoid that, webmasters usually publish what kinds of scraping they allow on their websites.

Terms of service are usually broad, so searching for “scraping” or “crawling” is a good idea. \n",

    "## Scraping Wrap-Up\n",
    "\n",
    "Scraping is a way to get information from website that were not designed to make data accessible. As such, it can often be **brittle**: a website change will break your scraping script. It is also often not welcome, as a scaper can cause a lot of traffic. \n",
    "\n",
    "The way we scraped information here also made the **assumption that HTML is generated consistently** based just on the URL. That is, unfortunately, less and less common, as websites adapt to browser types, resolutions, locales, but also as a lot of content is loaded dynamically e.g., via web-sockets. For example, many websites now auotmatically load more data once you scroll to the bottom of the page. These websites couldn't be scraped with our approach, instead, a browser-emulation approach, using e.g., [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) would be necessary. [Here is a tutorial](https://medium.com/the-andela-way/introduction-to-web-scraping-using-selenium-7ec377a8cf72) on how to do that. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, many services make their data available through a well-defined interface, an API. Using an API is always a better idea than scraping, but scraping is a good fallback!"
